Sometime back when we had published an article in the magazine about what it takes to be a successful food blogger, we had a flurry of emails asking what food blogging is really about. While most food bloggers may know what food blogging is about, does the world know what food blogging is?

Honestly even I am confused at times, is it a journal about the food I’m cooking, the stuff I’m eating, restaurants I’m visiting? Or is it a license to gawk at bowls, plates and cups, thinking of props and stopping at random places to look at discarded pieces of wood that can be used as a rustic background for your images? I say this, because I have done all this and more.

So let’s start with what can be construed as food blogging:
The Cooking and Posting Bloggers: These are the bloggers who cook extensively, and post about their cooking stories along with super appetising pictures. It could be anything from a blog that documents highly authentic recipes, or experiential food or just about anything that one is cooking. There will most often be a story accompanying the blog post. The Pioneer Woman Cooks is a great example of such a blog.

The Restaurant Reviews: These bloggers are the people we can count on to review restaurants for quality of food, ambience, service, price range and so on. This is much more detailed version of a restaurant guide and will almost always include a little story about why they loved or hated the food, what motivated them to go in the first place and so on. A Girl has to Eat blog is one such food blog.

The Super Niche Blogs: These are bloggers who catalogue a very niche subject within food itself. No Bake blogs, Gluten-Free blogs, Vegan blogs etc would come under this. Theirs is a repository of recipes that not only chronicles the food they are eating, but also gives a glimpse of their lifestyle choices. Sous Vide Life, a joint blog by Adam Phillabaum and Trevin Chow will show you what I mean.

Most often a food blog has overlapping elements of these three things. It’s usually a niche that is talked about with great detailing and story telling and occasionally has product and restaurant reviews. But there is no real rule. A blog is a personal journal. And obviously anything you want to say about food through your blog, and as long as your blog is mainly about food, becomes a food blog.

So what do you do if you want to be a Food Blogger?
First things first. You need a blog. You can start one on any blogging platform out there like Wordpress, Tumblr, Blogger or medium. Cucumbertown is the world’s only blogging platform dedicated to just food blogging. So the tools here are obviously tailor made for food bloggers.

Once you have identified the platform, you can begin by naming the blog, getting started on a subdomain, or if you are ready for it, get your own domain and basically create an identity for your blog. Keep these things in mind while naming your blog, besides the obvious: it’s availability:

  <h1>CHINESE FOOD</h1>
  <p>Chinese cuisine is an important part of Chinese culture, which includes cuisine originating from the diverse regions of China, as well as from Chinese people in other parts of the world. Because of the Chinese diaspora and historical power of the country,</p>
  <p>Chinese cuisine has influenced many other cuisines in Asia, with modifications made to cater to local palates. Chinese food staples such as rice, soy sauce, noodles, tea, and tofu, and utensils such as chopsticks and the wok, can now be found worldwide</p>

  <h1>Indian Food</h1>
  <p>Indian cuisine consists of a wide variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the range of diversity in soil type, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially from each other and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hindu, cultural choices and traditions</p>
  <p> The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule, particularly the Mughal rule. Samosas and pilafs can be regarded as examples</p>
